Based on the code snippet provided, it seems to be a configuration file written in YAML format. However, it doesn't appear to be a code written in any programming language.

To upgrade the code to a specific programming language version, please provide the actual code snippet written in that language with the target version, and I'd be happy to help you upgrade it according to the language features, standards, and best practices of the specified version.
