The current version of the code appears to be written in Java 8. 

Here's the modified code compatible with Java 11, incorporating new language features, standards, and best practices:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice.Repository;

import com.UST.departmentservice.Model.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Department, Long> {
    Department findByDepartmentId(Long departmentId);
}
```

Upgrade Changes:
- No changes were necessary for this code as it is already compatible with the latest Java version (Java 11).
