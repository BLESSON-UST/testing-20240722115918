The current version of the code is written in Java 8. 

Here is the modified code upgraded to Java 11:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class DepartmentServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DepartmentServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

In this upgraded version, the code remains unchanged because there are no specific new language features, standards, or best practices in Java 11 that need to be incorporated in this code snippet.
