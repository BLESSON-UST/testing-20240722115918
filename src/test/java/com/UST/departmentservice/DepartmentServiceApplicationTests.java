The current version of the code is written in Java 8. To upgrade the code to Java 16, the modified code is as follows:

```java
package com.UST.departmentservice;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest
class DepartmentServiceApplicationTests {

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
	}

}
```

Note: Since there are no language features, standards, or best practices specific to Java 16 that need to be incorporated in this code snippet, the modified code remains the same.
